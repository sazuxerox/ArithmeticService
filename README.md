# ArithmeticService
This is a WCF program which has multiple service contract and multiple operation contract on one of the service contract. A host is also created to host this service. And a windows client consumes that service. This program exposes four endpoints. But I use only two of them. If a web client is initiated then other two can also be used for consuming this service.
